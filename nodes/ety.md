# &lt;ety&gt;

Etymologies, shortened in ODXML to "ety" for simplicity, are the linguistic roots of a given word. Wiktionary often separates word definitions by their etymologies, however, even single definitions can be related to an etymology. Therefore, it is required each [Entry node](https://www.odict.org/odxml-nodes/entry.html) contain at least one etymology. Etymologies have an optional description attribute, to describe in further detail the origins or root of a word.
